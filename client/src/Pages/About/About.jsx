            The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that
             human beings can understand them clearly
            . A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic
             and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate 
            the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.

            The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is the lawgiver.
             No playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful, has ever exercised 
             such absolute authority to arrange a stage or field of battle and to command such
              unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.
